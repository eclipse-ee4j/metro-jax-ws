    <title>AsyncProvider</title>

    <para>Web Service endpoints may choose to work at the XML message level by
    implementing the <literal>Provider</literal> interface. The related
    information about <literal>Provider</literal> endpoints is documented in
    <xref linkend="users-guide-provider" xrefstyle="select:title" /> page.
    However <literal>Provider</literal> endpoints are synchronous i.e. they
    receive XML requests and they return XML responses synchronously in
    <literal>invoke()</literal> method. If the endpoint wants to spawn a
    thread to process the request, it would block the jax-ws runtime thread
    and has to manage all the low details synchronizing the threads when the
    response is available. Also blocking a thread doesn't really scale well
    especially when the underlying transport is capable of handling
    asynchronous request and responses. RI provides an implemention specific
    solution to this problem by introducing <literal>AsyncProvider.</literal>
    This is similar to <literal>Provider</literal> endpoints but the
    difference is that the endpoint implementations have to implement
    <literal>AsyncProvider</literal> interface.</para>
