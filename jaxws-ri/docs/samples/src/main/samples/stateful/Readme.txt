This sample shows the JAX-WS RI's stateful webservice support feature.
Built on top of WS-Addressing, this mechanism allows the application
to easily maintain state on server-side objects, and allows clients to
distinguish instances.

See the javadoc of the server and the client for more details.

* To run
    * set JAXWS_HOME to the JAX-WS installation directory
    * ant server - runs annotation processing to generate server side artifacts and
      does the deployment
    * ant client run - compiles the client application and runs it.
    * This sample imports a remote schema. If you are running this sample from
      behind a firewall you need to provide the proxy server information. Simply
      scroll down to the bottom of build.xml file and uncomment the <setproxy.../>
      element and provide your proxy server information and then do 'ant run'.
