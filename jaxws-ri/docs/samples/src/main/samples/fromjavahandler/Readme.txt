fromjavahandler sample demonstrates the use of handlers while using
the Java->WSDL programming model.

* The service class has one method:
    * addNumbers() that takes two integers and returns an integer
* etc - configuration files
    * custom-client.xml client customization file
    * custom-schema.xml client customization file for schema objects
    * build.properties, deploy-targets.xml ant script to deploy the endpoint
      war file
    * sun-jaxws.xml deployment descriptor for web container
* src source files
    * client/AddNumbersClient.java - client application
    * server/AddNumberImpl.java - server implementation
    * server/AddNumberException.java - server implementation
    * common/LoggingHandler.java - handler used to log messages

* annotationProcessing ant task is run to compile AddNumbersImpl and create server
  objects used during deployment and runtime.

* For the server handler, the AddNumbersImpl class includes a HandlerChain
  annotation that points to a handler configuration file called handlers.xml.
  This file describes a handler chain containing one handler of type
  fromjavahandler.common.LoggingHandler. When the service is deployed,
  this handler is instantiated and added to the service.

* For the client handler, the customization file custom-client.xml
  includes an extra <bindings> element containing a handler chain
  description. The schema for the <handler-chains> element is the same
  for both handler chain files (on the server) and customization files.

* To run
    * set JAXWS_HOME to the JAX-WS installation directory
    * ant clean server - runs annotation processing to generate server side artifacts and
      does the deployment
    * ant clean client run - runs wsimport on the published wsdl by the deplyed
      endpoint, compiles the generated artifacts and the client application
      then executes it.

* Prerequisite
