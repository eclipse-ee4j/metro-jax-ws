mime sample demonstrates the WSDL Mime binding for specifying attachments in 
the wsdl description and its mapping to Java types. One can use the following 
to describe attachments in a wsdl.

    * mime:content a binding construct to indicate the message part is bound to 
      an attachment
 
    * wsiap:swaRef a schema construct defined by WS-I Attachment Profile 1.0 to 
      indicate a reference to an attachment in the message

JAXB defines mapping of MIME types and Java types, and wsiap:swaRef. JAX-WS 
defines mapping of mime:conent to Java types.

One can use customization to enable or disable default mime:content mapping 
rules by using jaxws:enableMIMEContent binding declaration. Notice that, 
custom-client.xml and custom-server.xml use this customization to 
enable/disable mime:content mapping. This sample also shows how one can use 
wsiap:swaRef to refer to an attachment in the message.

* It has the follwoing operations
    * echoData - enableMIMEContent is false
    * echoDataWithEnableMIMEContent - enableMIMEContent is false
    * detail - Mapping of XML schema element to javax.xml.transform.Source
    * claimForm - wsiap:swaRef example

* etc - configuration files
    * hello.wsdl wsdl file
    * custom-client.xml client customization file
    * custom-server.xml server customization file
    * build.properties, deploy-targets.xml ant script to deploy the endpoint
      war file
    * sun-jaxws.xml deployment descriptor for web container

* src source files
    * client/MimeApp.java - client application
    * client/AttachmentHelper - utility class for handling attachments.
    * server/HelloImpl.java - server implementation

* wsimport ant task is run to compile etc/AddNumbers.wsdl
    * generates
      SEI - Hello
      service class - HelloService
      and other classes representing the Java beans for the schema constructs 
      used for request/response.

* To run
    * set JAXWS_HOME to the JAX-WS installation directory
    * ant clean server - runs wsimport to compile hello.wsdl and generate
      server side artifacts and does the deployment

    * ant clean client run - runs wsimport on the published wsdl by the deployed
      endpoint, compiles the generated artifacts and the client application
      then executes it.
    * This sample imports a remote schema. If you are running this sample from
      behind a firewall you need to provide the proxy server information. Simply
      scroll down to the bottom of build.xml file and uncomment the <setproxy.../>
      element and provide your proxy server information and then do 'ant run'.
