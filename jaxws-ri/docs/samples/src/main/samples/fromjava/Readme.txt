fromjava sample demonstrates the Java->WSDL programming model.

* The service implementation class has one method:
    * addNumbers() that takes two integers and returns an integer and
      it throws the AddNumbersException as a checked exception
* etc - configuration files
    * custom-client.xml client customization file
    * custom-schema.xml client customization file for schema objects
    * build.properties, deploy-targets.xml ant script to deploy the endpoint
      war file
    * sun-jaxws.xml deployment descriptor for web container
* src source files
    * client/AddNumbersClient.java - client application
    * server/AddNumberImpl.java - server implementation
    * server/AddNumberException.java - server implementation
    * server/AddWebservice.java - Publishes endpoint using Endpoint API
    * server/EndpointStopper.java - Stops the published Endpoint API endpoint

* annotationProcessing ant task is run to compile AddNumbersImpl and create server
  objects used during deployment and runtime.

* To run in servlet container
    * set JAXWS_HOME to the JAX-WS installation directory
    * ant clean server - runs annotation processing to generate server side artifacts and
      does the deployment
    * ant clean client run - runs wsimport on the published wsdl by the deplyed
      endpoint, compiles the generated artifacts and the client application
      then executes it.

* To run as j2se webservice endpoint
    * ant clean server-j2se - generates server side artifacts and does the deployment using Endpoint API
    * ant clean client run - runs wsimport on the published wsdl by the deplyed
      endpoint, compiles the generated artifacts and the client application
      then executes it.
    * ant server-j2se-stop - stops the service
