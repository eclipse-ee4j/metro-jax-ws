fromwsdl sample demonstrates the use of handlers while using
the WSDL->Java programming model.

* It has two operations with different MEPs
    * in/out - addNumbers()
    * oneway - onewayInt()
* etc - configuration files
    * AddNumbers.wsdl wsdl file
    * custom-client.xml client customization file
    * custom-server.xml server customization file
    * build.properties, deploy-targets.xml ant script to deploy the endpoint
      war file
    * sun-jaxws.xml deployment descriptor for web container
* src source files
    * client/AddNumbersClient.java - client application
    * server/AddNumberImpl.java - server implementation
    * common/LoggingHandler.java - handler used to log messages

* wsimport ant task is run to compile etc/AddNumbers.wsdl
    * generates
      SEI - AddNumbersPortType
      service class - AddNumbersService
      and exception class - AddNumbersFault_Exception

* Both the custom-client.xml and custom-server.xml files contain a
  handler chain with a single handler of type
  fromwsdlhandler.common.LoggingHandler.

* To run
    * set JAXWS_HOME to the JAX-WS installation directory
    * ant clean server - runs wsimport to compile AddNumbers.wsdl and generate
      server side artifacts and does the deployment
    * ant clean client run - runs wsimport on the published wsdl by the deplyed
      endpoint, compiles the generated artifacts and the client application
      then executes it.
