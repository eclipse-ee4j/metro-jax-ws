/**
 * Factory to create {@link JAXBContext}.
 *
 * <p>
 * JAX-WS uses JAXB to perform databinding when you use the service endpoint interface, and normally
 * the JAX-WS RI drives JAXB and creates a necessary {@link JAXBContext} automatically.
 *
 * <p>
 * This annotation is a JAX-WS RI vendor-specific feature, which lets applications create {@link JAXBRIContext}
 * (which is the JAXB RI's {@link JAXBContext} implementation.)
 * Combined with the JAXB RI vendor extensions defined in {@link JAXBRIContext}, appliation can use this to
 * fine-tune how the databinding happens, such as by adding more classes to the binding context,
 * by controlling the namespace mappings, and so on.
 *
 * <p>
 * Applications should either use {@link UsesJAXBContextFeature} or {@link UsesJAXBContext} to instruct
 * the JAX-WS runtime to use a custom factory.

     *      The {@link SEIModel} object being constructed. This object provides you access to
     *      what SEI is being processed, and therefore useful if you are writing a generic
     *      {@link JAXBContextFactory} that can work with arbitrary SEI classes.

     *      List of classes that needs to be bound by JAXB. This value is computed according to
     *      the JAX-WS spec and given to you.
     *
     *      The calling JAX-WS runtime expects the returned {@link JAXBRIContext} to be capable of
     *      handling all these classes, but you can add more (which is more common), or remove some

     *      List of {@link TypeReference}s, which is also a part of the input to the JAXB RI to control
     *      how the databinding happens. Most likely this will be just a pass-through to the
     *      {@link JAXBRIContext#newInstance} method.

     *      If the callee encounters a fatal problem and wants to abort the JAX-WS runtime processing
     *      of the given SEI, throw a {@link JAXBException}. This will cause the port instantiation
     *      to fail (if on client), or the application deployment to fail (if on server.)
