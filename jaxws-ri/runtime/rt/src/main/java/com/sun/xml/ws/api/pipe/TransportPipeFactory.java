/**
 * Factory for transport pipes that enables transport pluggability.
 *
 * <p>
 * At runtime, on the client side, JAX-WS (more specifically the default {@link PipelineAssembler}
 * of JAX-WS client runtime) relies on this factory to create a suitable transport {@link Pipe}
 * that can handle the given {@link EndpointAddress endpoint address}.
 *
 * <p>
 * JAX-WS extensions that provide additional transport support can
 * extend this class and implement the {@link #doCreate} method.
 * They are expected to check the scheme of the endpoint address
 * (and possibly some other settings from bindings), and create
 * their transport pipe implementations accordingly.
 * For example,
 *
 * <pre>
 * class MyTransportPipeFactoryImpl {
 *   Pipe doCreate(...) {
 *     String scheme = address.getURI().getScheme();
 *     if(scheme.equals("foo"))
 *       return new MyTransport(...);
 *     else
 *       return null;
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link TransportPipeFactory} look-up follows the standard service
 * discovery mechanism, so you need
 * {@code META-INF/services/com.sun.xml.ws.api.pipe.TransportPipeFactory}.
 *
 *
 *
 * <h2>TODO</h2>
 * <p>
 * One of the JAX-WS operation mode is supposedly where it doesn't have no WSDL whatsoever.
 * How do we identify the endpoint in such case?
