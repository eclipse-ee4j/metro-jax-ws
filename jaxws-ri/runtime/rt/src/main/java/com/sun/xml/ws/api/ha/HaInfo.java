/**
 * This class has HA information
 * <p>
 *
 * This would help a loadbalancer to put the request(in case of a fail-over)
 * on a replica instance that has all the related data. Even if there is no
 * loadbalancer, a backing store could locate the information by directly
 * going to the correct replica instance. This would also help any part of
 * the runtime to know about failover case(and in-turn may invalidate
 * local caches).
 *
 * <p>
 * To achieve this functionality, it carries two pieces of information:
 * <ol>
 * <li>key - Related {@link org.glassfish.ha.store.api.BackingStore} keys can
 * use this info for their HashableKey impl. First store creates this object,
 * and subsequent related stores use the same key.
 * <li>replicaInstance - where the related info is replicated
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * This can be accessed from {@link Packet} using {@link Packet#HA_INFO}
 * property by the runtime. This object is created typically
 * <ul>
 * <li> When a store happens for the first time
 * <li> A subsequent inbound transport creates from cookies
 * <li> A fail-over request stores the data to a different replica
 * </ul>
