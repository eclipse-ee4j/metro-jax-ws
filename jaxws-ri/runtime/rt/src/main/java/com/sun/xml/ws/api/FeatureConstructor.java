 * For WebServiceFeature annotations to be recognizable by JAX-WS runtime, the feature annotation should point
 * to a corresponding bean (class extending WebServiceFeature). Only one of the constructors in the bean MUST be marked
 * with @FeatureConstructor whose value captures the annotaion attribute names for the corresponding parameters.
