/**
 * Resolves relative references among {@link SDDocument}s.
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface is implemented by the caller of
 * {@link SDDocument#writeTo} method so
 * that the {@link SDDocument} can correctly produce references
 * to other documents.
 *
 * <p>
 * This mechanism allows the user of {@link WSEndpoint} to
 * assign logical URLs to each {@link SDDocument} (which is often
 * necessarily done in a transport-dependent way), and then
 * serve description documents.
 *
 *
 *
 * <h2>Usage Example 1</h2>
 * <p>
 * HTTP servlet transport chose to expose those metadata documents
 * to HTTP GET requests where each {@link SDDocument} is identified
 * by a simple query string "?<i>ID</i>". (HTTP servlet transport
 * assigns such IDs by itself.)
 *
 * <p>
 * In this nameing scheme, when {@link SDDocument} X refers to
 * {@link SDDocument} Y, it can put a reference as "?<i>IDofY</i>".
 * By implementing {@link DocumentAddressResolver} it can do so.
