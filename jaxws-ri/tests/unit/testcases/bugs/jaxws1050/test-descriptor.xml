<descriptor since="2.2.6" bugs="jaxws-1050">
    <description>
        Although the jaxws-1050 is not real bug - the wsdl isn't correct,
        a regression in rearch2005 tests indicates, this case should't fail
        (definitely not with NPE); behavior changed to display warning
        but not fail (see: testcases/rt_wsdl_parser )
